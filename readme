# Wordle

This project is a simple Wordle-style game developed with Angular.
The goal of the game is to guess a target word within a limited number of attempts, receiving visual feedback for each guess.
The application is composed of a single game screen, where the player defines a target value and starts making guesses.

# Environment Configuration:
- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies by running npm install
- Run ng serve command to initialize the application
- Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/test

# Project Features:

- Target value setup:
Before starting the game, the user must define a target value, which represents the word to be guessed.

- Word guessing:
After setting the target value, the user can start typing guesses. Each guess must have the correct word length.
If the submitted word is incomplete, the game will display a “word too short” message.

- Color feedback system:
After submitting a guess, each letter receives visual feedback:

🟩 Green: the letter is correct and in the correct position.

🟨 Yellow: the letter exists in the target word but is in the wrong position.

⬜ Gray: the letter does not exist in the target word.

- Game status:

The game indicates when the player wins by guessing the correct word.

The game indicates when the player loses after reaching the maximum number of attempts.
